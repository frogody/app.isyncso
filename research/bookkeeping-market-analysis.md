## Key Market Insights

### 1. AI is the Differentiator
QuickBooks' Intuit Assist and Digits are leading with conversational AI. The market is moving from "software that helps you do accounting" to "AI that does accounting for you."

### 2. Unlimited Users = Competitive Advantage
Xero's unlimited users on all plans is a major selling point. Per-user pricing is increasingly seen as outdated.

### 3. Automation Over Features
Zoho Books' workflow automation (up to 500 rules) shows that automation capabilities are becoming more important than raw feature count.

### 4. Free Tier Drives Adoption
Wave's free model proves that free core features + paid add-ons can build massive user bases.

### 5. AI-Native Will Win
Bench's failure vs. Digits' success shows that genuine AI automation beats human+AI hybrid models.

### 6. Vertical Integration Matters
All successful platforms integrate deeply with payments, banking, and payroll. Isolated accounting software is dying.

### Long-Term Vision
